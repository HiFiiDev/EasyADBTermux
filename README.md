# EasyADBTermux
The easier way to ADB on unrooted Android 10

The primary function of this script is to make ADB easily functionable on Android 10,
With it also being backwards compatible for other Android versions.

The secondary function of this app is to eventually create a customized experience
For pulling a logcat!

For now this is a work in progress, which means every part is not close to 100% yet.
Please feel free to test this and help breaks things for me to make this better.
